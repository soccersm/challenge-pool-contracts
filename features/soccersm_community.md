- For the moment, users can only create pools on specific subjects.

- Crypto
- Soccer

- We automatically resolve these pools because we have APIs for them. However, for random statement pools we cannot resolve automatically because we do not have any api over them.

- For random statements, we are the only ones able to create and delete those pools. With Soccersm Communities, we want to allow users to create their random pools and resolve them independently.

- A community is a group of players who create and resolve their random pools without our intervention.

- Any user can create a community and share invite others to join by sharing the link. For example I create a community for my class group and we can then create our own pools and resolve. 

- A community can be private or public. 

1. A private community is only visible to those who have joined.
2. A public community is visible in the community section of the website.
